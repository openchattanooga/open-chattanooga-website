  event_organizers:
    description: >
      One of the most important roles is being an event organizer. Events enable 
      the Brigade to exist. Several Brigades have found it helpful to have 
      Brigade members rotate event logistics. It is not that you need someone to 
      do everything in organizing an event, i.e. planning partnerships and 
      programming. You need someone who can book space, arrange equipment, 
      refreshments, set up, configure registration, etc…
      
      
      This role requires the skills reserved for a party planner.
