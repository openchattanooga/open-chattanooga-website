##Scribe / Documentor (open position)
A Scribe is someone who takes notes at Brigade events; helps keeps track of city council minutes and public hearings and reports back at hacknights; helps write training materials; keeps local wikis up to date; and/or writes software documentation. 

This role requires strength in written communication and time to email and call local media. 

##Developer Evangelists (open position)
A developer evangelist acts as a mentor to other Brigade members and/or out of Brigade network individuals working on Brigade created products. Sometimes this person takes on a role as a repo manager. Developer evangelists are common throughout technical communities and play the same role within a Brigade.

##Policy Evangelists (open position)
A policy evangelist acts as a mentor to other Brigade members and helps educate the public and officials on open government, open data, and on the civic hacking practice. Within our communities, Law and Policy are “code” for physical space. Software is code for the digital space. 

Policy evangelists are dedicated to understanding their municipal policy on Open Government, Open data, et. al.

This role requires patience, a really good networker, and a dash of political savviness.

##Event Organizer (open position)
One of the most important roles is being an event organizer. Events enable the Brigade to exist. Several Brigades have found it helpful to have Brigade members rotate event logistics. It is not that you need someone to do everything in organizing an event, i.e. planning partnerships and programming. You need someone who can book space, arrange equipment, refreshments, set up, configure registration, etc... 

This role requires the skills reserved for a party planner.
